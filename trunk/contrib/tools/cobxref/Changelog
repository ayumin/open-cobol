        v0.95.75  * fixed bugs regarding Special-names and file-control
                    where one or both may not be present. Extra suport
                    for Report writer but note that user names will be shown
                    where user has declared it ie, Select, FD, RD, WS etc
                    This could show duplicate entries for ones in FD, RD & WS
                    but that seems to help in analysis.
                    Code now in free format and some if statements now have
                    end-ifs as code changes but only ones where logic flow
                    might be a problem to keep it easy to read. There is many
                    programming languages that have periods '.', ':', and/or';'
                    to terminate lines and that works fine.
                     Cobol is no exception.
                    Consider being back all code for COPY verbs in case
                    xref is used stand alone for for another compiler in
                    release v0.96.00 which may well be the next release subject
                    to bug reports.

2009-02-13  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.68  * Now support for user defined words in WS areas not
                    covered ie Report Writer (ba040 - ba049) ie:
                    line|col|column [number|linage is]
                    fore|background||control|size|key [is]
                    thru|through & start|length [of]
                    footings [at]  &  top|bottom
                    and any other

2009-02-12  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.67  * Added support for special-names Currency sign is
                    as needed for test at ws on PIC.
                    Also added extra tests here for other leading chars.
                    Hopefully will now clear cobol85 tests in NC.
                    Rewritten procedure processing code for more support
                    in (hjhkjhkjh) etc including colon and lits etc.
                    Additional coding for listings.
                    This version clears All cobol85 tests without failure.
                    Added 3 additional non-reserved reserved words to lists
                    so that they are not reported on.

2009-01-31  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.44  * Restored -G param Group listings to make it easier to
                    compare listings from xref with MF or IBM as they are
                    more basic.

2009-01-20  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.43  * extra sub verbs in screen section added more needed
                  * ditto in ws sub verbs see DONE.
                  * Added to function table: CONCATENATE, SUBSTITUTE/-CASE

2009-01-14  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.41  * Support for free format source lines up to 255 chars
                  * Support for Cobol word sizes of 31 chars and allowance
                    for this to be increased without major problems
                    both in compliance for INCITS PL 22.4 20xx

2009-01-13  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.40  * Cleared bugs related to ws fields used in proc. with
                    )) after, ditto the (1 1 1) format. These bugs traced
                    after putting a large m/f program through OC and xref
                    which needless to say fails in TC
                  * Temporary working files (Partn.tmp) now stored in
                    TMPDIR or TMP or TEMP or if not present /tmp directory.
                    This works for Linux and should for WinDoz as TMP
                    is defined at least at the system level. Also Path
                    name limits increased to 1024 chars for working files.
                  * Other changes made to cater for cobxref being called by
                    cobc.

2009-01-03  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.24  * added Check for unreferenced Globals in nested modules
                    and extra report for it
                  * More code clean ups
                  * Removed unneeded we-are-testing code and shrunk performs
                    but more to do

2008-12-30  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.20  * Clear loop on processing nested programs due copy proc
                    removal to cobc o/p (fn.i) and others co-related issues.

                  * clear other bugs also related to above.
                  * Removed un-needed parameters to xref
                  * Removed very old unused reports & rearranged function report
                  * Found problems related to nested progs not showing global
                    conditions in nested after 1st - To DO
                  * Unref'd fields in nested to be reported at end - DONE
                  * Issued version to sourceforge & add1tocobol

2008-12-21  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.13  * Added in updated reserved.c lists which include
                    SUBSTITUTE and some new functions
                  * System reserved names are deliberately omitted so
                    that they appear in xref listings.
                  * Cleared some more cosmetic bugs in reports
                  * Issued version to sourceforge

		    code for profiling

2008-12-14  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.02  * Input changed, now input comes via cobc using progname.i
	            (filename.i) ONLY. All COPY verb processing removed as the
		    .i file has already processed COPY verbs & compiler
		    directives
                  * Changed source to free format & related code & removed
		    source outputs as no longer needed.
                  * Omit source on report unless requested (-R)
                  * Added compiled date and build no. on headings to help bug
		    reporting.
                  * Any new changes/bug fixes will increment build no.
                  * Added version/build nos plus build date to headings & help.
                  * fixed odd bug in proc div in form with ["kk") and/or] format
                  * Code for producing 01 record layout sizing but should it be
		    added?

2008-03-29  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>

		    new prog ie ID Division but ok in .lst
                    This may relate to the next bug.
                  * Incorrect processing of srcs with min. headers, ie, not
