        v0.95.02  * Input changed, now input comes via cobc using progname.i 
	            (filename.i) ONLY. All COPY verb processing removed as the 
		    .i file has already processed COPY verbs & compiler 
		    directives

		    source outputs as no longer needed.

                    This may relate to the next bug.
                  * Incorrect processing of srcs with min. headers, ie, not 
		    going to ba000 section etc
