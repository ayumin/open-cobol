                    SUBSTITUTE and some new functions
                  * System reserved names are deliberately omitted so
                    that they appear in xref listings.

                  * Issued version to sourceforge

        v0.95.02  * Input changed, now input comes via cobc using progname.i 
	            (filename.i) ONLY. All COPY verb processing removed as the 
		    .i file has already processed COPY verbs & compiler 
		    directives
                  * Changed source to free format & related code & removed 
		    source outputs as no longer needed.
                  * Omit source on report unless requested (-R) 
                  * Added compiled date and build no. on headings to help bug 
		    reporting.
                  * Any new changes/bug fixes will increment build no.
                  * fixed odd bug in proc div in form with ["kk") and/or] format
                  * Code for producing 01 record layout sizing but should it be 
		    added?

2008-03-29  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.94.00  * On multi progs in source not sending to .src 1st  line of 
		    new prog ie ID Division but ok in .lst
                    This may relate to the next bug.
                  * Incorrect processing of srcs with min. headers, ie, not 
		    going to ba000 section etc 
                  * literals using ' not treated as " in places
