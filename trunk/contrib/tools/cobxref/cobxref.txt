Cobxref - Cobol Cross Reference program / module for Open Cobol

Documentation for Beta release version 0.95.20            Dated 30th Dec 2008

Parameters for running program are in the form:

cobxref 1 [2 3 4 5 6] where params 2 through 6 are all optional   

Note: Param 1 MUST be first param, 2 through 6 can be in any order

1: SFN.i [Source File name] (Mandatory) file produced from cobc 
         using -save-temps or -E (Also see below)

2: -R	 Print out source code prior to cross reference listings

3: -L    reports all in lowercase (defaults to uppercase or actual case used).

4: -DR   Display All reserved words & stop. Note: Must still specify a source file
         name of at least 5 charascters in length even if it's a dummy.

5: -TEST Produces testing info (and this can be a lot of output). Used for Debugging
         by or on behalf of programmer. (See below for command line example)

6: -H	 Displays program parameter info (same as when run without any params}
   --H	 as -H

Prior to running cobxref:
************************
You must supply SFN.i as created from cobc with -save-temps or -E set, this is 
a free format source file of your program with insignificant leading spaces 
removed and all copy verbs pre-processed. Specifically, prior to running cobxref
you need to run your program through cobc by running:
cobc -save-temps -x your-prog.cbl   or to just create the input for cobxref
having only preprocessed your source  run: 
cobc -E your-prog.cbl > your-prog.i

REMEMBER to run this every time prior to running cobxref otherwise it might be
running against a old version of your source code. It is hoped that cobxref will 
be included with cobc during 2009.

When using OC (Open Cobol). this is the only method of usage. It might be an 
idea to create a shell script to run both programs against a specific source 
file.

Running cobxref:
***************
For normal usage just call as 'cobxref sourcefilename.i'
This assumes you have run 'chmod +x cobxref' and that your run path includes 
the current directory otherwise use './cobxref sourcefilename.i'

This will assume that source is taken from cobc as described above and that all 
cobol sections will be reported individually as well as separate reports for: 
variable and conditions, sorted both by conditions then by variables, Procedure 
sections, Unreferenced working storage, unreferenced procedure sections and paragraphs.

Tarbell is supplied with cobxref object with static code (self contained).

Source code in C as generated by cobc. To compile run comp-cobxrefc.sh in same 
directory containing cobxref source code. Please check that the includes for lib 
and mods is pointing in the correct direction ie, /usr/local/lib and 
/usr/local/include.

If recompiling from cobol source use cobc -x cobxref.cbl.
Please do not make changes without recording the amendment in code with notation 
at or near actual code changes. After your tests, please advise of changes direct 
to myself at vbcoen@btconnect.com and through the OC forum.


I have been testing this program against a range of my own code as well as some 
of the test programs /modules provided with open cobol.  I now think it is ready 
for general usage but please if you can, test it against another cross reference 
tool to see if it is producing the same results and advise of any discrepancies.


Please provide any and all reports of bugs through the open cobol forum.


After, in field testing, I will try and have it linked into the open cobol 
compiler.
