Cobxref - Cobol Cross Reference program / module for Open Cobol

Documentation for Beta release version 0.95.13            Dated 21st Dec 2008

Parameters for running program are in the form:

cobxref 1 [2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] where params 2 through 9 are all optional   

Note: Param 1 MUST be first param, 2 through A can be in any order

1: SFN [Source File name] (Mandatory)

2: -R	 Print out source code prior to cross reference listings

3: -G    produce only group W-S xref
   -A    produce Full group/procedure only
   -GA   produce both Full group/procedure and individual
   -GB   produce both group and individual W-S xref
         Defaults to individual reports per section ie, File, Working-Storage etc.

4: -L    reports all in lowercase (defaults to uppercase or actual case used).

5: -SC   Sorts Conditions in Var/Cond table instead of Variables.

6: -DR   Display All reserved words & stop. Note: Must still specify a source file
         even if a dummy.

7: -TEST Produces testing info (and this can be a lot of output). Used for Debugging
         by or on behalf of programmer.

8: -V	 Verbose output (show more info on screen when running)

9: -H	 Displays program parameter info (same as when run without any params}
   --H	 as -H

For normal usage just call as 'cobxref sourcefilename.i

This will assume that source is in free format and that all cobol sections will 
be reported individually as well as separate reports for: variable and conditions, 
Procedure, Unreferenced working storage, unreferenced procedure sections and 
paragraphs.

You must supply SFN.i as created from cobc with -save-temps set, this is a free 
format source file of your program with insignificant leading spaces removed and
all copy verbs pre-processed.
When using OC this is the normal and now, the only method of usage.

Tarbell is supplied with cobxref object with static code (self contained).

Source code in C as generated by cobc. To compile run comp-cobxrefc.sh in same 
directory containing cobxref source code. Please check that the includes for lib 
and mods is pointing in the correct direction ie, /usr/local/lib and 
/usr/local/include.

If recompiling from cobol source use cobc -x cobxref.cbl.
Please do not make changes without recording the amendment in code with notation 
at or near actual code changes. After your tests, please advise of changes direct 
to myself at vbcoen@btconnect.com and thru the OC forum.


I have been testing this program against a range of my own code as well as some 
of the test programs /modules provided with open cobol.  I now think it is ready 
for general usage but please if you can, test it against another cross reference 
tool to see if it is producing the same results and advise of any discrepancies.


Please provide any and all reports of bugs through the open cobol forum.


After in the field testing I will try and have it linked into the open cobol 
compiler.


TODO Lists subject to demand:

1. Support for qualifiers in Working Storage or paragraph/section names etc.

2. Support for taking params through the standard cobol config file/s.
   or via cobc.
