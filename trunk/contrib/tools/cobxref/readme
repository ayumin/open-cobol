			       CobXRef
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/cobxref/


CobXRef is a Cobol cross reference tool that reads a Cobol source file as
output by Open Cobol's cobc with the -save-temps parameter supplied and 
produces a file suitable for printing 'as is' that contains all variables, 
procedure paragraphs and section names referenced where they are defined 
as well as where they are used throughout the program or module.

It will read a source file containing a standalone program or many program & 
modules providing they confirm to the Cobol standard in the same way that 
OpenCobol does.

Cobxref should only be run against source code that has been processed by cobc 
without errors and optionally without warnings
 
[OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL programs to 
C code and compiles it using GCC on multiple platforms and operating systems]

All code and programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License.
See COPYING for details.


Requirements
============

OpenCobol package installed and tested working. See documentation supplied with 
OpenCobol. You MUST have run the test procedures including the cobol85 suite.

Installation
============

Linux/Unix:
Just place cobxref in directory of source code to be cross referenced. Making 
sure that the execute flag is set (chmod +x cobxref). In the event that the 
binary does not work you will need to recompile the GCC C source code or the 
Cobol source code. The easiest way to compile the C code is to run the 
comp-cobxrefc.sh script but only after you have checked and modified it to 
reflect the location where you have installed the needed libraries. As supplied
it will point to /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib for the cobol libs.

Windows/Mac:
Compile the Cobol source see below.

In the event this does not work you must have installed and tested OpenCobol.
Note this will not work 'as is' with Tiny Cobol or any other compiler.

To compile with OpenCobol:

Place cobxref files in own directory having moved to same directory.
From terminal program run:

cobc -x cobxref.cbl

This will produce a statically linked executable called cobxref
which you can place in a common directory that is listed in your PATH,
ie., /usr/local/bin [needs root access] or /home/username/bin.
