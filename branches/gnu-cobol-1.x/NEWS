* 20140118 GNU Cobol 1.1 released

* 20130927 GNU Cobol 1.1 announced. GNU-ification of source code commencing

* 20130510 Retagging OpenCOBOL 1.1 pre-rel as OpenCOBOL 1.1
           OpenCOBOL 1.1 CE announced

* 20090206 OpenCOBOL 1.1 pre-rel released

* OpenCOBOL 1.0 released

* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.33

** New compile option '-x'. This causes the compiler to produce an
   executable program. '-fmain' is deprecated.

** Remove long option --verbose. Use '-v' for verbosity. Problem is
   with getopt_long_only which does not like eg. -mv 

** New conformity option -std=bs2000.

** FUNCTION is implemented. See cobc/reserved.c for a list of what is
   implemented.

** Nested programs are partially supported.

** LINAGE is implemented.

** EXTERNAL on FD is implemented.

** SAME RECORD AREA is implemented.

** New config variables - 
   "perform-osvs", "sticky-linkage". These are
   activated for -std=ibm and -std=mvs.
   "relax-level-hierarchy". Allows mismatched data
   description level numbers. Activated for
   -std=mf, ibm, mvs and bs2000.

** Support for non-gcc compilers.

** Large file support, system dynamic loading and Berkeley DB inclusion
   are default for the configure.
   ie. ./configure assumes --with-db --with-lfs64 --with-dl

** New configure option --with-patch-level=<n>
   Default is 0. 

** At run time, version checking is done. ie. When executing/loading
   Cobol programs, the version (eg. 0.33) and the patch level (eg. 0)
   are checked against the OC library version/patch level.

** Libtool is not required for systems that support native dynamic
   loading. This includes GNU/Linux, Cygwin and MingW amongst others.

** Note to developers : See README for required software versions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.32

** Stability update - See individual ChangeLogs

** New internal register - NUMBER-OF-CALL-PARAMETERS

** New config variables - larger-redefines-ok, relaxed-syntax-check

** Powerpc changes - We now pass all OC and Cobol85 tests

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.31

** Stability update - See individual ChangeLogs

** New driver program - "cobcrun"
   This allows all application programs to be compiled as
   modules and driven by "cobcrun" similar to MF's "cobrun".
   Syntax - cobcrun <MAINPROG> [Arguments to program "MAINPROG"]
   As "cobcrun" is linked with the static version of Open Cobol
   libraries, it is easier to maintain concurrent versions on the
   same system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.20

** cobpp has been integrated into cobc.

`-main' has been renamed to `-fmain', which is turned on
by default if none of -E, -C, -S, -c, or -m is given.

The format will not be detected automatically.  You need
to use SOURCE FORMAT compiler directive as described below.

Put the following line at the beginning of file if you
want to use the free-form:

  >>SOURCE FORMAT IS FREE

If you want to expand the program text area over 72 columns,
use the option `-column' instead.

** New option `-T', which specifies the tab width.

** New warning options:

  -Wall                 Enable all warnings
  -Wcolumn-overflow     Warn any text after column 72
  -Wconstant            Warn inconsistent constant
  -Wparentheses         Warn lacks of parentheses around AND within OR
  -Wnext-sentence       Warn uses of NEXT SENTENCE
  -Wimplicit-terminator Warn lacks of scope terminator (END-XXX)
  -Wstrict-typing       Warn type mismatch strictly
