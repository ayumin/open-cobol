CobXRef is a Cobol cross reference tool that reads a Cobol source file as output
by Open Cobol's cobc with the -X, -E or -save-temps parameters supplied and
produces a file suitable for printing 'as is' that contains all variables,
procedure paragraphs and section names referenced where they are defined
as well as where they are used throughout the program or module and optionally
preceded by a listing of the source. Note that if run via cobc using -E source
listing will pre-seed the cross reference listing.

It will read a source file containing a standalone program or many program &
modules providing they confirm to the Cobol standard in the same way that
OpenCobol does.

Cobxref should only be run against source code that has been processed by cobc
without errors and optionally without warnings when using cobc param -W.

[OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL programs to
C code and compiles it using GCC on multiple platforms and operating systems]

Requirements
============

OpenCobol package installed and tested working. See documentation supplied with
OpenCobol. You MUST have run the test procedures including the cobol85 suite.

Installation
============

Linux/Unix:
Compile the source of cobxref.cbl and get-reserved-lists.cbl with the
Open Cobol compiler cobc using the supplied shell script comp-cobxref.sh with
the command ./comp-cobxref.sh at a command prompt using any terminal program.

Now place cobxref in a directory that is within the PATH making sure that the
execute flag is set (chmod +x cobxref) although this is done within the script.

Mac OSX:
Compile the Cobol source as for Linux/Unix.

In the event this does not work, you must have installed and tested OpenCobol.
Note this will not work 'as is' with Tiny Cobol or ANY other compiler.

Supplied files with the Cobxref tarbel:

NOTES:
*****

You must compile using an up to date version of Open Cobol (c) but not less
than version 1.1 dated Feb 2009.

These notes relate to versions of cobxref prior to the code being added to the
Open Cobol distribution.

Please also read Cobxref.txt for instructions on using cobxref.

As any bug fixes will be applied to the Cobol code please note that
all bug fixes should only be made to the original Cobol source code.
A master copy of the sources can be found at the add1tocobol web site.

Please report all bugs found to the OpenCobol forum at www.opencobol.org
and send a copy to the author at vbcoen@btconnect.com
