			       CobXRef
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/cobxref/


CobXRef is a Cobol cross reference tool that reads a Cobol source file as
output by Open Cobols cobc with the -save-temps parameter supplied and 
produces a file suitable for printing 'as is' that contains all variables, 
procedure paragraphs and section names referenced where they are defined 
as well as where they are used throughout the program or module.

It will read a source file containing a standalone program or many program & 
modules providing they confirm to the Cobol standard in the same way that 
OpenCobol does.
 
[OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL programs to 
C code and compiles it using GCC.]

All code and programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License.  
See COPYING for details.


Requirements
============

OpenCobol package installed and tested working. See documentation supplied with 
OpenCobol.

Installation
============


Just place cobxref in directory of source code to be cross referenced. In the 
event that the binary does not work you will need to recompile the source code. 
The easiest way is to run the com-cobxrefc.sh script but only after you have 
checked and modified it to reflect the location where you have installed the 
needed libraries. As supplied it will point to /usr/local/include and 
/usr/local/lib for the cobol libs.

In the event this does not work you must have installed and tested OpenCobol.  
Note this will not work 'as is' with Tiny Cobol or any other compiler.

To compile with OpenCobol:

Place cobxref files in own directory having moved to same directory.
From terminal run:

cobc -x cobxref.cbl

This will produce a statically linked executable called cobxref
which you can place in a common directory that is listed in your PATH,
ie., /usr/local/bin [needs root access] or /home/username/bin.
