Cobxref - Cobol Cross Reference program / module for Open Cobol

Documentation for Gamma release version 1.01.07            Dated 26 Sept 2010

Parameters for running program are in the form:

cobxref 1 [2 3 4 5 6 7] where params 2 through 7 are all optional

Note: Param 1 MUST be first param, 2 through 7 can be in any order.
      param 5 is for testing ONLY.
      Param 6 for testing against other ref products only

1: SFN [Source File name] (Mandatory)

2: -R	 If used will not print out source code. Otherwise cobxref will always do
         so prior to cross reference listings.

3: -L    reports all in lowercase (defaults to uppercase or actual case used).

4: -DR   Display All reserved words & stop. Note: Must still specify a source file
         even if a dummy.

5: -TEST Produces testing info (and this can be a lot of output). Used for Debugging
         by or on behalf of programmer.

6: -G    Used in testing: Produces group print out in addition to normal so that
         comparing xref's with Microfocus or IBM can be more easily done.

7: -H	 Displays program parameter info (same as when run without any params}
   --H	 as -H

For normal usage just call as 'cobxref sourcefilename.t' or you can also call it
using cobc with the -X option. This will also produce source listings followed by
the cross reference lists.

This will assume that source is in free format.

When run standalone, you must supply SFN.i as created from cobc with -save-temps
or with -E set, this is a free format source file of your program
with insignificant leading spaces removed and all copy verbs pre-processed.

You may have a version of cobc that gives the option of -X which will also
call cobxref during compilation. To check for this run cobc -h to confirm that
you have the -Xref option.

See additional notes in the readme file also details of any changes over prior
releases see Changelog.

If compiling from cobol source use the supplied shell script eg, comp-cobxref.sh

Note that for testing I use add to the cobc command line:
-Wtruncate
 Note that cobc will produce a warning:
    cobxref.cbl: In paragraph 'bb054-Spaces':
    cobxref.cbl:1902: Warning: Sending field larger than receiving field
    cobxref.cbl:252: Warning: 'wsFoundNewWord' defined here as PIC X(32)
 as OC cannot know that the sending field is limited by z to less than 32 chars,
 and various warnings regarding S-Pointer2, F-Pointer
 being shorter to b, s, z. Line-End and All-Fun-Idx: you can ignore these as
 well as moving s9(8) to s9(4). Note that the line address in the warning may
 be different that above


Please do not make changes without recording the amendment in the source code
with notation at or near actual code changes. After your tests, please advise of
changes direct to myself at vbcoen@btconnect.com, through the OC forum and/or
the add1tocobol website.

I have been testing this program against a range of my own code including a
42,000 line program (work on a IBM z/370 etc, as well as some of the test
programs & modules provided with open cobol.  I now think it is ready
for general usage but please if you can, test it against another cross reference
tool to see if it is producing the same results and advise of any discrepancies.


Please provide any and all reports of bugs through the open cobol forum.
