2009-01-31  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.45  * Restored -G param Group listings to make it easier to
                    compare listings from xref with MF or IBM as they are
                    more basic.

2009-01-20  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.43  * extra sub verbs in screen section added more needed
                  * ditto in ws sub verbs see TODO.
                  * Added to function table: CONCATENATE, SUBSTITUTE/-CASE

2009-01-14  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.41  * Support for free format source lines up to 255 chars
                  * Support for Cobol word sizes of 31 chars and allowance
                    for this to be increased without major problems
                    both in compliance for INCITS PL 22.4 20xx

2009-01-13  Vince Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.40  * Cleared bugs related to ws fields used in proc. with
                    )) after, ditto the (1 1 1) format. These bugs traced
                    after putting a large m/f program through OC and xref
                    which needless to say fails in TC
                  * Temporary working files (Partn.tmp) now stored in
                    TMPDIR or TMP or TEMP or if not present /tmp directory.
                    This works for Linux and should for WinDoz as TMP
                    is defined at least at the system level. Also Path
                    name limits increased to 1024 chars for working files.
                  * Other changes made to cater for cobxref being called by
                    cobc.

                    SUBSTITUTE and some new functions
                  * System reserved names are deliberately omitted so
                    that they appear in xref listings.
                  * Cleared some more cosmetic bugs in reports

        v0.95.02  * Input changed, now input comes via cobc using progname.i

                  * Changed source to free format & related code & removed
		    source outputs as no longer needed.

                  * Added version/build nos plus build date to headings & help.
                  * fixed odd bug in proc div in form with ["kk") and/or] format
                  * Code for producing 01 record layout sizing but should it be
		    added?
