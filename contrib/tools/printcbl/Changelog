	*    v2.01.12 Ensure that the NOPRINT statement does NOT get output.

	*    v2.01.11 Brought back 'access line sequential' for printer
	        as double line are being caused by a patch to OC v1.1/CE
	        in fileio.c  ??
	        Works perfect for OC v2.0.
	        This tool has how been placed on the GNU Cobol/Open Cobol
	        sourceforge sites code at /trunk/contrib/tools/printcbl.

	*    v2.01.10 Cleaned up original code (pre-Alfred) to work on OC v1.1
		As just needed to replace perform until exit with 
		perform forever.
		This has brought back the screen control for the help screen.

2013-03-08 Vincent B Coen/Alfred Cleve
	*    v2.01.08 Thanks to Alfred code modified to work with older
	     versions of the OC compiler (v1.1) unpatched.
	This file is printcbl-4-OC-1.1-unpatched.cbl
	  This includes marking out 'llcc background colour n' etc
	  where ll = line number and cc = column number.
           so some displays may well look a bit odd.
	   	This one I do not understand as I have programs written for
		v1.1 that this works with.
		Will have another look when time is available.
	*       Changed displayed and printed program name to printcbl. Silly error.

        *    v2.01.07 Fixed bug if free source starts in first column.

2012-06-10 Vincent B Coen
        *    v2.01.06 Trace bugs on processing Fixed formats & other stuff
        *       1. Found, Assuming again, COPY can start in cc8 fixed so
                    checking for " COPY " from cc8 will not work, changed to
                    start cc in fixed to 7 (free is cc 1).
        *       2, Allow Replacing Leading and Trailing to work but is really ignored.
        *       3. With 1. fixed change to to check record size depending on type
                   free from 255 and fixed from 72. Should speed it up a bit.
        *       4. Cleared bug: COPY statement not commented if creating new source
                   This clears all bugs found during regression testing (test11 thru 19).
        *       5. Cleared bug: Suppress stopped working, my own fault having removed code that
                   processed it when removing excess code in para bb070 and forgot to
                   replace it elsewhere !!
        *       6. Changed some hard code values of tables/occurs etc to use variables in WS

2012-06-02 Vincent B Coen
        *    v2.01.03 Start coding for Replace processing
        *       1. Code tested to build replace tables including size of
                    source and targets in replacing statements.
        *       2. Attempt to use Function Substitute to replace fields in buffer !!
        *       3. That does'nt seem to work so use on record.
        *       4. Clear out remaining bugs when using NOPRINT
        *       5. and some others found during testing. and now for FIXED format testing

2012-05-22 Vincent B Coen
        *    v2.01.02 Bugs Fix
        *        1. When running with *>|**noprint comment out copy statements.

2012-05-21 Vincent B Coen
        *    v2.01.01--Complete rewrite and make free format - Program named printcbl.
        *        1. Add support for *>EJECT / *>eject in cc1 for free format source code or
                    "**EJECT / **eject in cc7 for fixed format, doing exactly the same
                    as '/' in cc7 for fixed format source.
                    Added because the '/' option is not available in free format.
        *        2. Changed options for P3 to allow for '-' not being present so will also accept
                    'FIXED' / '-FIXED'  'FREE' & '-FREE',
                     Due to a mistake on my part when testing, (Don't ask).
        *        3. Support for 'noprint' to create a new source file instead of a print report
        *        4. V. Initial code for Copy depths up to 9 including for usage as input source file.
                    This leave only the print file in FD usage.
        *        5. Init. code for 'Replacing' etc. BUT not available yet!!
        *        6. Bug found: Removed adding 1 to Line-Number-Count for error messages.
        *        7. Added copy depth no. after line number on printed line with COPY included
                    statements.
        *        8. Support for 9 depth levels of copy giving a total of 10 including source file.
        *        9. Clear bug in all previous versions on finding false COPY not after
                    number eg, word as in a DISPLAY. [This may not clear ALL possibilities but should].
        *       10. Copy tested with 'IN or 'OF' also 'SUPPRESS' and 'SUPPRESS PRINTING' eg, form:
                    COPY 'foo.ext' IN | OF 'library path' SUPPRESS | SUPPRESS PRINTING.
        *       11. Extra printed messages at end givng details of copy depth used and total number
                    of any copy files not found (usefull in testing any way).
        *       12. Bugs found in BB copy code not leaving correctly because buffer size not
                    created on new source record and other P3 oversets [ 2 Hours] : slipping

2012-04-16 Vincent B Coen
        *    09--BUG fixes:
        *        1  BUG: Issue with P5, Fixed. Change processing order.
        *        2. Make Source and Copy record size 256 chars from 132 to support max size
                    of free format sources but leave printed o/p at 133.
        *        3. Kill off format file as using lpr and system call to process print file
                    where lpr has params to select font sizing data and duplex operation etc.
        *        4. Removed functionality in updates 04, 06 & 07.1, Now that P4 is implemented.
        *        5. This version will be the last that is coded to the fixed format as I am
                    getting annoyed at the cc72 restrictions when coding. Also at this time I will
                    remove all of the dead code starting at v1.01.10.

2012-04-16 Vincent B Coen
        *    08--Fix missing copy lib paths above first one.
             (Dumb mistake with perform not with 'until exit').

2012-04-13/16 Vincent B Coen
        *    07--Changes as Listed:
        *     1. Use embedded PCL instead of filepath (for non JCurrey shop usage)
                 One installed works for HP printers Change to your requirements.
        *     2. Changed to use system call instead [7.1] to lpr with parameters to do same
                 thing so not so printer dependent see [P4] PSN below at [7.4].
        *     3. Get: OC Environment Vars (if exist): COBCPY & COB_COPY_DIR
        *     4. Program params P1, P2, P3, P4, p5
                 (P = Mandatory, p = Optional)
                 P1  = Input file
                 P2  = Output/print file
                 P3  = -free or -fixed
                 P4  = PSN (Print Spool Name)
                 p5* = Temp Library Path
                     * This will be 1st priority over the Env. Var copy books
        *     5. Link above into existing procedures.
        *     6. Remove firm copylib link (04)
        *     7. Cater for sourceformat free by P3 & in *>LIST/NOLIST at cc1
        *     8. change tests for 'COPY',list & nolist function upper-case,
        *     9. Changed line print per page from fixed 112 to WS-Page-Lines (init 112)
                  again to 99 for HPLJ
        *    10. I/P file changed to 256 chars from 132
        *    11. Changed version to v1.01.nn
        *    12. Added print date variations, US, UK & Intl
        *    13. Only search for ' COPY ' in first 220 chars
        *    14. Changed line no. to 5 chars & increased print line to 133.
        *    15. Clean up displays & accepts at start and display help if no params
                 given in command line.
        *    16. Clean up header, reduced page count size to 999.
                 Added Title/version etc.
        *    17. Set up basic Local Time zone for dates.
                 Really need to use env. val LOCALE but not sure all systems and
                 OC v1.1 supports it. See value in WS-Local-Time-Zone instead,
                 currently set to *unix (ccyy/mm/dd)
        *    18. Support for COPY "foo" in/of "../../par" both single or double quotes (', ")
                 WARNING: No support for replacing clause or processing is ONLY to one copy level.
                 EG, no copy within copy. Will look at later if needed and likewise
                 replacing clauses but hey, one thing at a time!
        *    19. Support for '/' in column 7 for fixed source format
                 ONLY, which will eject paper prior to next line. That means the eject line '/'
                 will be the last line before page throw. Hey, Sorry that's as close
                 as I can do it without a lot of code changes.

2009-12-14 Jim Currey & Pete Mcthompson
        *    06--Uses external pcl code file to insert pcl code into print file for formatting.

2009-04-22 J C Currey
        *    03--Adds nolist and list support (note not supported by opencobol compiler)
        *        **nolist in col 7-14 turns off listing
