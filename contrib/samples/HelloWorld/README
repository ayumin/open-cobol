Welcome to GNU Cobol
====================

Hello from GNU Cobol.

These simple programs are meant as early introductions to GNU Cobol and COBOL
programming.

Compiling
=========

To try out the samples, either type **make** or::

    cobc -x hello.cob
    cobc -x bigworld.cob

followed by::

    ./hello
    ./bigworld

to run the programs.

To learn more during the compile stages try::

    cobc -x -v hello.cob
    cobc -x -v bigworld.cob

which shows the various commands used to build GNU Cobol executable programs
from the COBOL source code.

Cheers from the GNU Cobol contributors.
