OpenCOBOL TODO						-*- outline -*-

1 Pending requests

1.1 Handling of EBCDIC files

2 Other features to be implemented

2.1 Embedded SQL

Frank Polscheit posted his implementation of SQL preprocessor.
(2004-02-17: SQL pre-processor for OPEN-COBOL)

Firebird (firebird.sourceforge.net) has a SQL preprocessor
for their database.

2.2 New backends for INDEXED files

 - Look at C-ISAM replacements

3 Improvement of compiler internals

3.1 Error checking

3.1.1 Strict error checking depending on the standard
Partially implemented

3.1.2 Use `error' token in the parser for better error recovery

4 Optimization

4.1 More inlining of run-time functions

Done with various binary operands

5 Debugging support

5.1 Data access method

We should generate all data hierarchy defined in a COBOL program
with all relevant information, including data names, picture clauses,
and source locations.  We should also define a debugging function
that receives a data name and displays its value using the generated
data hierarchy.  By calling the function from gdb, we can easily
access the COBOL data at debugging time.

6 Better user manual

Yes, we should
